                In the Fall of 2003 planning for a new Digital Libraries Research Program had largely been completed, 
                based on the findings and recommendations of the Chatham Workshop and in response to recommendations 
                and guidance offered in reports including the PITAC report “Digital Libraries: Universal Access to Human 
                Knowledge” and the January 2003 “Report of the National Science Foundation Blue Ribbon Advisory Panel on 
                Cyberinfrastructure” as well as to the large number of technical workshops and international working groups 
                which continued to define new and dynamic areas of interdisciplinary research.  The Chatham Workshop had 
                called for a substantial investment over a 5 year period in both research and infrastructure development.  
                The NSF Budget Request to Congress also identified digital libraries research as an important area of investment.
                <br>
                However implementation of the new digital libraries research program was abruptly terminated.  With new management 
                at NSF came reprogramming of budgets and restructuring of the research divisions.  Investment in digital libraries 
                research and infrastructure was determined to be of a lower priority.  A limited number of digital libraries related 
                activities continued to be funded through the Information Technologies Research Program (ITR) program and through 
                discretionary funds in some programs.  However without a central, named, and separately budgeted digital libraries 
                research program, the digital libraries research community lost a major cohesive component and an obvious program 
                to which to submit a proposal.

              <p>            
                In September of 2004, a Digital Archiving and Long-Term Preservation (DIGARCH) Program Solicitation (NSF 04-592) was released.  
                This was a jointly sponsored effort between the Division of Information and Intelligent Systems (IIS) and the Office of Strategic 
                Initiatives (OSI) of the Library of Congress.  Although modest in terms of investment ($2.3M), the scope was broad and the focus 
                was of great importance.  The projects funded would focus on: a) digital repository models; b) tools, technologies and processes, 
                and, c) organizational, economic and policy issues.  A total of 25 projects were funded addressing these areas.
                <br>
                For years, many people believed that once converted into digital form, information would gain indefinite longevity and permanence.  
                In fact the opposite was becoming increasingly evident – digital media degraded at a faster rate than that on which analog data was 
                recorded.   In addition, the amount of digital information was estimated to nearly double every year. (Lyman and Varian, 2003) 
                By the close of 2010, the size of the “Digital Universe” was estimated to measure over one million petabytes and had surpassed 
                the available capacity to store it.
                <br>
                Several workshops had been convened to establish a research agenda for digital preservation and archiving and had identified long-term 
                preservation of digital materials as a critical national issue.  In addition, the joint NSF-EU working group coordinated with the 
                DELOS Network of Excellence to produce a set of recommendations and justifications for investment in a report entitled “Invest to 
                Save: Report and Recommendation of the NSF-DELOS Working Group on Digital Archiving and Preservation”.
                <br>
                The Library of Congress Office of Strategic Initiatives (OSI) had already initiated an exceptionally informed and far-reaching program 
                for preservation of born-digital content, the National Digital Information Infrastructure Preservation and Archiving Program (NDIIPP) 
                (www.digitalpreservation.gov).  The program was remarkably effective, due in large measure to the leadership of Laura Campbell, 
                Associate Librarian, and senior managers of OSI and the efforts of its staff in organizing a network of partners with stakeholders 
                representing interests across a broad spectrum of organizations.  The implementation strategy has been recognized as a model for 
                excellence and productivity.
                <br>
                The Library of Congress continues to be a leader in developing processes and community building for the preservation and stewardship 
                of born digital content through its National Digital Stewardship Alliance program.
