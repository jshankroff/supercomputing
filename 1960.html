            <div class="timeline-body">
              <p>In the beginning, the computer was a calculating machine. Computers were large metal boxes, referred to as “Big Iron,” 
                that churned through batch processing jobs, producing a result. Eniac, the first American digital programmable computer, 
                built during World War II, processed ordinance trajectories. Colossus, the first electric programmable computer, was built 
                by 
                <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/people/alan_turing">Alan Turing</a> 
                and the British in order to break the German Enigma code. 
                After the War, the vision of a computer as a computational device engaged in patch processing persisted.
                <br>
                In the 1960s, J.C.R. Licklider radically altered the vision of computers. Licklider, with a PhD in psychophysiology, 
                focused not on the computers themselves, but on how humans interacted with computers. 
                In 1960, he published his seminal work 
                <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/medg/people/psz/Licklider.html">"Man Computer Symbiosis"</a>.</p>

              <p>The 1960s was the era of Big Iron computers. These were massive machines, that took up entire rooms, that required a lot of air conditioning, 
                and - compared to the computer in your pocket - didnt have a lot of processing power. Built by companies such as IBM, these 
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer">massive main frames </a>
                came to have the nickname "Big Iron." 
                <br>
                These computers were not networked, did not have a common operating system or common software, and had to 
                be programmed in batch jobs using punch cards. Work from one machine was not easily transferable to another machine. Individual's access to the 
                machines was privileged, and rationed through a system of time sharing. A new commercial service emerged of data processing services. At 
                universities, ownership of a main frame was a matter of prestige. If DARPA funded a new computer at one unversity, the other funded university 
                computer center's grew jealous and wanted brand new hardware - their existing computer resources now being "outdated." These small machines were 
                expensive. Steve Crocker recalls "On IBM’s flagship mainframe computer, the IBM 7094, the memory unit – what you would now call the RAM – held 
                one megabit, i.e. about 128KB, and cost about one million dollars in the early 1960s."

              "Larry Roberts 'concluded that the most important problem in the computer field before us at the time was computer networking; the ability 
              to access one computer from another easily and economically to permit resource sharing.' Roberts recalled, 'That was a topic in which Licklider 
              was very interested and his enthusiasm infected me.'"

              Larry Roberts: "I concluded from that whole conversation that the thing to work on would be the communications between computers and to computers, 
              because the computer stuff itself was a big team activity at that point, and one that I thought I knew how to handle anyway. Both Corby had done a 
              good job with MIT system and we had done the same thing at Lincoln, and we knew how to build timesharing systems with multiple users, and the real 
              challenging task was to try to interlink these systems now."
