              In 1993, the internet was still dominated by the United States but it was becoming a truly
              global network. Information flowed on Usenet, an bulletin board application
              that allowed users to swap recipes, jokes, programming tips, and more.

              In the early 1990s, the National Science Foundation (NSF), Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) 
              and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) each were supporting basic research in computing 
              and communications and began to see the value of digital content organized into “digital libraries” as a broad, 
              newly emerging research area of great potential. (Griffin, 1998)

              The initiative grew out of the agencies’ recognition of the increasing demand for network-based systems and 
              services capable of providing diverse communities of users with coherent access to large, geographically 
              distributed stores of many types of digital content. The technical viability for undertaking this effort was 
              based on dramatic advances being made in computing and communications technologies, infrastructure and supporting 
              services as well as an exceptionally high level of demand. 

              The first program announcement:  “Research in Digital Libraries (NSF93-141): A Joint Initiative of the National Science Foundation, 
              (Defense) Advanced Research Projects Agency and the National Aeronautics And Space Administration” was released in the fall of 1993 
              to select and fund up to six projects at up to $1.2M/yr for four years.  The Digital Libraries Initiative was designed as a basic 
              research initiative, broadly cast to advance the means to collect, store, organize and access information in digital form via the 
              internet (Griffin, 1998).  It identified five broad areas of research:</p>
 
              <ul>
                <li>1. Capturing data of all forms (text, images, sound, speech, mixed and multimedia, etc.) and descriptive information about the data (metadata)</li><br/>
                <li>2. Categorizing and organizing electronic information in a variety of formats.</li><br/>
                <li>3. Creating advanced software and algorithms for browsing, searching, filtering,</li><br/>
                <li>4. Abstracting, summarizing and combining large volumes of data, imagery, and all kinds of information; and</li><br/>
                <li>5. Utilization of networked databases distributed around the nation and around the world.</li><br/>
              </ul>
 
              <p>The internet was the main consideration driving the program.

                In 1994, the Clinton Administration privatized the internet backbone. Commercial firms
                took over the job of carrying long-distance internet traffic, allowing the government-funded
                NSFNET to be decommissioned. Officials were careful to ensure that no single company
                controlled too much of the backbone, helping to create a competitive market for internet
                connectivity that still exists today. These four maps illustrate how the market had evolved
                by the turn of the century. Four of the largest private long-distance network providers were
                UUNet, AT&T, Sprint, and Level 3. Each had its own nationwide (and global) network, and
                they competed with each other to provide long-distance connectivity to smaller networks.
                UUNet became part of WorldCom in 1996, and became part of Verizon in 2006. Today,
                Verizon operates one of the world's largest internet backbones, in competition with AT&T,
                Sprint, Level 3 and many other companies.

                In 1999, an Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) award was made to Stanford to fund work 
                on a new model for electronic journal modeling, High Wire Press, that also involved a collaborative, 
                easy-to-use, distributed web cache to allow libraries to recover lost materials.  Subsequently, a 
                new software architecture called LOCKSS (Lots of Copies Keeps Stuff Safe) was designed and built by David Rosenthal, 
                a distinguished software engineer.  It enabled a web library system where storage and management was at once 
                localized, decentralized, distributed, highly replicated, easy to use, inexpensive to operate and hardware independent.  
                It is in widespread use today. (http://lockss.stanford.edu/)

                The Carnegie Mellon Informedia project produced new metadata extractors and summarizers for video content.

                The Cornell project, with additional funding from the international program (described later in this paper),
                workshop supplements and SGER awards, would make significant progress on digital repository technologies by developing 
                the Fedora open source technologies and later Duraspace. (http://fedora-commons.org/)The project also partnered with 
                Los Alamos National Laboratory and the University of Southampton, UK to create a sustained framework for open access 
                and archives by initiating the Open Archives Initiative. (www.openarchives.org)

                The Columbia Project, Personalized Search and Summarization over Multimedia Information (PERSIVAL), worked within hospital,
                medical research and clinical environments and developed prototype system components for diagnostic procedures, 
                search of heterogeneous, patient specific and multimedia medical records and produced new forms of document summarization, 
                term definition and video summarization resources.  It employed machine learning technologies and meta-search techniques 
                in helping to build advanced capabilities in this realm as well as using formal concept models to organize and present digital 
                library content and visualize concepts as well as relationships between digital content.
